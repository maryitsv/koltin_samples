    List
    ordered collection
    elements can be accessed by the position(index) indices start with 0
    can contain duplicated elements
    samples
    [1,2,3,632,52,6,1,2 ]
    [43,44.3,3,76.354]
    a sentence is a list of words: they have an order and can repeat.

    Set
    Group of unique elements
    The order has no significance
    we can go through the elements one by one but the order is not defined
    samples
    [1,2,3,632,9,52,6]
    A deck of cards is a set

    Map
    A set of key-value pairs
    Keys are unique(set)
    Each key maps to exactly one value
    values can be duplicated
        {1=one, 3=three, 5=five}
    a dictionary is a Map
        Maps words to definition
